Design:

- Store front is created on codeingiter MVC framework.
- Following is the brief description of various components

Models:

 - Product : Provides functions to search for products based on query param, load product by id, load related products (products having same group id)

 - Product/Uploader : Class which facilitates uploading products to store using a csv.

Views:
 
 -Homepage : basic store front page, with search bar to search for products
 -Search_Result : Page which displays search results
 -Product_page : Product details page 

Controller:

 Application works on a single controller class 'Movies' 

 Following are the various possible routes
 
  - www.movies.com ##home page
  - www.movies.com/movies/upload  ## page to upload products using a csv file
  - www.movies.com/movies/product/<id> ## product page 

DB: 
	Table : movies (group_id, product_id, movie_title, category, sub_category, store, price, shipping_description )
	All products are uploaded to this table:
	upload scripts checks if group_id is empty is yes adds to by extracting it from product_id.

Usage :

 - Search for movie titles with keywords are separated by space. exact matches are displayed first followed by partial matches.

Note:

All model , view and controller classes can be found inside ../application/

TroubleShooting:

 - For large CSV files, HTTP 413 error comes which can be fixed by increasing the client request body size paramenter.
	For example : in nginx add client_max_body_size 2M; to nginx.conf in http block.
