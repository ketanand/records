						We love music. And we are sure you do, too. Well, that's why you are here, right? And that's why we at RecordsTree have started off on this journey. A journey whose destination we don't know, and frankly, don't even care about. Because what we really care about are the varied sounds we hope to discover along the way. And when we are talking about the sounds of our country, varied is quite an understatement.
